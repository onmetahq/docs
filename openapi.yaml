      # Testing Information

          Do not make any payment on staging environment, enter a random (unique) number as UTR and proceed 
          Quotation will be calculated according to the production, however, we will be transferring only 0.01 WMATIC at once to the receiver’s wallet address in the staging environment.
          Even for Offramp, quotation shown and actual number of tokens that needs to be sent are different. We take only 0.01 WMATIC and there will be no fiat deposit.

        ## Sample JS code

        ```js
        <script >
            let createWidget = new onMetaWidget({
                // (It should be an id of an element not a class) which is set in step 2 above
                elementId: "widget", // Mandatory
                apiKey: "{api_key}", // Mandatory
                environment: "staging" //Mandatory , "production" for Prod
                walletAddress: "0xEcc24eab0fb83Ef0c536b35C44C578F750FDBB6E", // Optional
                fiatAmount: 100, // Optional (If passed then minimum amount is 100 inr)
                userEmail: "test@test.com", // Optional (if passed user don't have to register in meta platform)
                chainId: "80001", // Optional (it should be passed along with the tokenAddress to show a particular token to the user)
                tokenAddress: "0xEcc24eab0fb83Ef0c536b35C44C578F750FDBB6E", // Optional
                metaData: {"userID" : "ABCDXXX", "userName" : "user"} // Optional
                successRedirectUrl : "https://www.sample.net", // Optional
                failureRedirectUrl : "https://www.sample.net", // Optional
            });
            createWidget.init(); // it will initialize the widget inside the particular div element
            createWidget.on(eventType, callbackFn); // this method will listen to the events of the widget
        </script>
        ```

        **Note:**
         By default widget will be initialised with OnRamp functionalities only. 
         And only INR 100 is the valid amount for order creation in staging and Mumbai Matic is the only token supported for now to test the end to end onramp flow .


        Widget initialisation happens when you call  **createWidget.init();**   and all the respective events are notified back to the parent and once can handle event based actions respectively by passing the callbackFn names to the events like this **createWidget.on(eventType, callbackFn);**

        **callbackFn** - Its the function you have to pass along with the eventType. This function will get called when the event is fired.

        ## Widget creation with React Native 

        Define two variables one for html content and one for javascript content 

        ```js
          import {View, StyleSheet, Text, Linking} from 'react-native';
          import WebView from 'react-native-webview';
          export default function App() {
            const onRampHTMLCode = `
            <html>
            <head>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
            <script src="https://stg.platform.onmeta.in/onmeta-sdk.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
            </head>
            <body>
            <div id="widget"> </div>
            <script>
            let createWidget=new onMetaWidget({
              elementId:"widget",
              environment: "staging", //Mandatory , "production" for Prod
              apiKey:"api_key",  //update your api key here
              userEmail:"sample@gmail.com",
              isAndroid:"enabled", 
            })
            createWidget.init();
            createWidget.on("ACTION_EVENTS",(data)=>{window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage(JSON.stringify(data))}) 
            </script>
            </body>
            </html>
            `;
            const onRampEvent = event => {
              const eventData = JSON.parse(event?.nativeEvent?.data);
              if (eventData?.data?.type === 'UPI_FAST') {
                void Linking.openURL(eventData.data.link);
              }
            };
            return (
              <View style={styles.container}>
                <Text>Onmeta</Text>
                <WebView
                  originWhitelist={['*']}
                  mixedContentMode="compatibility"
                  source={{html: onRampHTMLCode}}
                  renderLoading={() => {
                    return <Text>Loading.......</Text>;
                  }}
                  startInLoadingState={true}
                  allowsBackForwardNavigationGestures
                  scalesPageToFit={true}
                  javaScriptEnabled={true}
                  mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction={true}
                  domStorageEnabled={true}
                  onMessage={event => {
                    onRampEvent(event);
                  }}></WebView>
              </View>
            );
          }
        ```

        ## Events

        Below are the eventTypes and its description.

        | Event                  | Description                                                                 |
        |------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | `ALL_EVENTS`           | Listens to **all events** triggered by the widget and invokes the callback. |

        # Customizing Widget
          Since widget has optional parameters that can be set during initialisation, let's see what are parameters that can be configured with it and how to enable OffRamp functionality as well.

          **Note:**
          By Default widget will be initialised with Onramp feature.
          And Default fiat is only INR , for PHP contact our sales team to enable it. and from widget initialize fiatType:php for PHP 

          1. Offramp only.
          Offramp can be enabled by setting the flag to offRamp: **enabled** as shown in below example.

          ```js

          <script>
            let createWidget = new onMetaWidget({
              elementId: "widget", // Mandatory (It should be an id of an element not a class)
              apiKey: "api_key", // Mandatory
              userEmail: "test@test.com", // Optional (if passed user don't have to register in meta platform)
              chainId: "80001", // Optional (it should be passed along with the tokenAddress to show a particular token to the user)
              tokenAddress: "0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee", // Optional
              offRamp: "enabled", // to enable offRamp feature
              onRamp: "disabled" // to disable onRamp feature
            });
            createWidget.init(); // it will initialize the widget inside the particular div element
          </script>
          ```

          2. OffRamp and OnRamp
            Both on and off ramp can be enabled by setting respective flags to a value as **enabled** as shown below.
          ```js
          <script>
            let createWidget = new onMetaWidget({
              elementId: "widget", // Mandatory (It should be an id of an element not a class)
              apiKey: "api_key", // Mandatory
              userEmail: "test@test.com", // Optional (if passed user don't have to register in meta platform)
              chainId: "80001", // Optional (it should be passed along with the tokenAddress to show a particular token to the user)
              tokenAddress: "0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee", // Optional
              offRamp: "enabled", // to enable offRamp feature
              onRamp: "enabled" // to enable onRamp feature
            });
            createWidget.init(); // it will initialize the widget inside the particular div element
          </script>

          ```

          3. To set default input type as crypto in offramp widget

          ```js
            sellCryptoType: "coins" //initialise this parameter within widget object to get crypto as input by default
          ```
       
        # Embedding widget

        Once you are ready with the widget configuration you can embed the code within your HTML web app and start using it instantly.

        Sample code shown below on how to embed the widget within a HTML page.

        **Note:**
        For demo setup use the below script tag only.

        ### Things to verify : 
          Test  api key from staging dashboard can be used with below sample code.
          
          Live api key from live dashboard can be used with live SDK so change the script tag url as shown in above note.

          ```html
          <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html lang="en">
            <head>
              <meta charset="UTF-8" />
              <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
              <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
              <title>Document</title>
              <!-- Add script in head -->
              <script src="https://stg.platform.onmeta.in/onmeta-sdk.js"></script>
            </head>
            <body>
              <div id="widget"></div>
              <script>
                let createWidget = new onMetaWidget({
                  elementId: "widget",
                  apiKey: "test_api_key",
                });
                createWidget.init();
                createWidget.on("ALL_EVENTS", (data) => console.log("ALL_EVENTS --> ",data))    
            </script>
            </body>
          </html>
          ```

          ### Events from Widget Onramp:

          The widget events gives you data to take action on and utilise it with callBack functions and few of the responses are as below. Here orderID is unique for that transaction.

          **Order Created waiting for UTR.**

          ```json
            {
                "eventCategory": "order",
                "paymentStatus": "pending",
                "cryptoSwap": "pending",

                    "buyTokenAddress": "0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174",
                    "orderId": "6346bf17af14a27251aa2ca8",
                    "createdAt": "2021-10-12T13:20:23.289Z",
                    "chainId": 80001,
                    "customer": {
                        "email": "test@onmeta.in"
                    }
                }
            }
          ```

          **UTR captured.**
          ```json
            {
              "eventCategory": "order",

          ### Events from Widget Offramp:

          **Order creation event**
          ```json
            {
                eventCategory: 'order', 
                paymentStatus: 'pending', 
                cryptoSwap: 'pending',
                paymentType: 'sell'
            }
          ```
          **In progress event**
          ```json
            {
                eventCategory: 'order', 
                paymentStatus: 'pending', 
                cryptoSwap: 'success',
                paymentType: 'sell'
            }
          ```
          **Success event**
          ```json
          {
            eventCategory: 'order', 
            paymentStatus: 'success', 
            cryptoSwap: 'success',
            paymentType: 'sell'
          }
          ```

          Copy the above snippet to a file in your local machine and save it as **onmeta_widget.html** and update the **apiKey: "{demo_api_key}"** with the key you received in the demo dashboard. After this open this html file in browser and you will see the widget with the default tokens and start using it.

          **Note:**
          Don't make any money transfer for testing, enter random number as UTR and it will be processed.
          * UTR is 12 digit number for UPI and IMPS payment options
          and 16 digit alphanumeric for NEFT payment.
        
        # Production checklist

        Things to check before moving to production.
        
        **The script tag should be changed.**
        Kindly contact our sales team to get the details.

        **Api key needs to be changed to production api key**
        ```json
              apiKey: "api_key", //production key from dashboard - client-id.
        ```

        Make sure you use the **Mainnet** **chainID** and **tokenAddress** for the required tokens if you set from widget code, or else just select required tokens from the dashboard page.


        **Note:** 
        Sample values for Binance Smart Chain (BSC) mainnet chainID is 56 and USDT token address is as shown below. To find out Mainnet chain ID check this <a href=https://chainlist.org target="_blank"/>link</a>. 
        
        
        ```json
          let createWidget = new onMetaWidget({
            chainId: "56", // Optional (it should be passed along with the tokenAddress to show a particular token to the user)
            tokenAddress: "0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955", // Optional
          });
        ```

        For widget also we send webhook event data to call back url's registered in dashboard, kindly refer to webhook documentaion for onramp and offramp details.
        
        For KYC kindly allow below permission in the iOS webview implementation code.   **"allowsInlineMediaPlayback": true"** 

        # Steps to integrate custodial wallet (Offramp)

        <img src="docs/images/cust_off_03.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Alt Text" width="300" height="300" />

        **4. OTP API **
            Onmeta will send below request body to client's otp-api endpoint to send otp to user email.
            Client has to expose otp endpoint for onmeta.

          ```json

            {
                type: "onmetaSell",
                email: userEmail,
            }

          ```
          **5. User enters OTP (stores it locally)**
        
          <img src="docs/images/cust_off_04.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Alt Text" width="300" height="300" />

          **6. Select bank account**

          <img src="docs/images/cust_off_05.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Alt Text" width="300" height="300" />

          **7.Create Order**

          On clicking the confirm button above order will be created.


          **8.Transfer API**

          To get the crypto in users wallet send below request body to users withdrawal endpoint, 
          client has to expose transfer api endpoint for onmeta to make **transfer request.**

          ```json
              {
                  "email":"test@gmail.com",
                  "wAddress":"0x23134131",
                  "otp":"1234",
                  "receiverWalletAddress": "receiverWalletAddress",
                  "token":"10.6",
                  "orderDetails": {
                      "orderId": 12345,
                      "fiat": 100,
                      "tokenAddress":"0xeeeeeeeeeeee", //sell token address
                      "metaData": "sample" //optional if passed during widget init
                  }
              }  
          ```

          **Note:**
          If you pass any metaData for widget initialisation that will forwarded to you from above body within orderDetails filed.


          Below is the expected response for success case of transfer API.

          ```json
              {
                  "txnHash": "0x8a2585bb8b2c5bc4......0cf422b62e3a0331c0b7",
                  "orderId": "646dd7248...7bf5d2c"
              }
          ```

          Below is the expected reponse for failure case of transfer API. Set your error inside code filed to show in widget.
          
          ```json
          {
            "error": {
                "code":"INSUFFICIANT_FUNDS"
              }
          }
          ```
          **Withdrwaing Tokens**

          # Checkout flow - Onramp

          To open payment page directly with widget and to skip the quotation page, follow below steps.

          1. Create order via api and keep the orderID which you have received in api response.
          2. Initialize widget with orderID received in step 2.

          ### Step 1:

          ```js
            curl --location --request POST 'https://stg.api.onmeta.in/v1/orders/create' \
            --header 'Accept: application/json' \
            --header 'x-api-key: string' \
            --data-raw '{"buyTokenSymbol":"string","chainId":"string","fiatCurrency":"string","fiatAmount":"string","buyTokenAddress":"string","receiverAddress":"string"}'
          ``` 

          **Note:** 
          You need to have auth token to call create order api as above else you will receive 401 Unauthorized error.


          Response :
          ```json
            {
                "success": true,
                "data": {
                    "orderId": "989073230",

                                "imageUrl": "https://ik.imagekit.io/z3vwasz5xwz/Meta_widget/Payment_icons/bhim_t366jHPDh.svg"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                },
                "error": {}
            }
          ```

          ### Step 2: 
          ```js
            <script src="https://stg.platform.onmeta.in/onmeta-sdk.js"></script>
              <div id="widget"></div>

              <script>
                    let createWidget = new onMetaWidget({
                      elementId: "widget",
                      apiKey: "bujbw93003j4",
                      userEmail: "test@test.com",
                      onRamp: "enabled",
                      fiatType: "inr",
                      fiatAmount: 100, //needs to be same as create order value
                      orderId: "6496b1f3dbde72d010890d84", // orderId from step 1
                      walletAddress: "", 
                    });
              </script>
          ```

          once you pass orderID to widget Initialisation params, it will fetch order details and load the widget with prefilled data and take user directly to payment page.

          ```

          follow the steps given below and integrate the On/Offramp widget within your app, below is the sample integration

          ```js
            import MetaWidget from "@onmeta/react-native-sdk";

            const eventHandler = async (event, data) => {
              switch (event) {
                // example to open the upi apps
                case "upi-intent": {
                  const Linkdata = await JSON.parse(data);
                  void Linking.openURL(Linkdata.link);
                }
                default: {
                  // Default code
                }
              }
            };

            <MetaWidget
              queryParams={{
                apiKey: "*****MERCHANT_API_KEY********",
                environment: "STAGING/PRODUCTION",
              }}
              onEventHandler={eventHandler}
            />;

        <img src="docs/images/KYC_with_Widget_01.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"  alt="Alt Text" width="300" height="300" /> 

        **Note:**
        This feature is not available by default, if needed talk to our sales team.
        
        | Document     | Remarks                                                                 |
        |---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        |Income tax ID  |  PAN Card (India specific)
        |Address verification Document | Aadhaar card (India specific)
        | Selfie photo | Need to take selfie during verification
  
        Lets see in the next section how to use above documents and enabel KYC within Widget.

        ## KYC as separate widget

        KYC can be used as separate widget for verification purpose.
        To use just KYC as separate widget you need to initialize the url as below format 
        
        ```html
            https://stg.platform.onmeta.in/kyc/?apiKey=<your_apikey>
        ```

        and rest of the steps are self explanatiory in the widget just follow the instructions. 
        If face is not matched with any of the Photo ID provided user account will go to manual KYC verification and it will be processed within 24hrs.

        Additionally you can set success and failure re-direct url's in the widget url, 
        here is an example :

        ```html
          https://stg.platform.onmeta.in/kyc/?apiKey=<your_apikey>&successRedirectUrl=<your_success_url>&failureRedirectUrl=<your_failure_url>
        ```

        All webhook events for KYC can be captured as well, you need to setup callback url in dashboard as shown below

        **24. How much is the gas fee? Are you customizing the gas fees for different blockchains?**

        Gas fee varies from chain to chain. It is calculated by using the combination of the gas price and the gas units needed to process the transaction. We fetch live gas price and gas units to enable fast transactions on your behalf.

        **28. What is UTR?**

        UTR means Unique transaction reference. This is a number that the remittance bank account issues for the fiat amount that you transfer to us. It is typically present in the SMS confirmation that the bank sends for the transaction made by you. 

        **29. Do you allow the reuse of the same UTR for a new order?**

        We allow an user to place another order with the same UTR only if the order associated with the UTR is “Canceled”. Typically an order gets canceled if the amount mentioned by the user in the widget is different from the amount transferred. We allow this so the user is able to use the genuinely transferred money to place a fresh order.

        **30. Where can the users find UTR?**

        Unique Transaction Reference (UTR) is typically a 12 digit number for UPI transactions. This can be found in the SMS messages that users receive from their UPI providers.

        **31. Do you do validation of UTR entered?**

        We currently validate if the UTR entered is in the valid UTR format for UPI transactions

        **32. What should users do if they enter a wrong UTR?**

        After entering the UTR, you would typically be waiting for the payment confirmation. In this screen there is an option reenter UTR and submit again.

        **33. Is the UTR case sensitive?**

        Yes, UTR is case sensitive. Please make sure you enter the UTR in the same case as it is present in the SMS message.

        **34. What is Onmeta's average transaction processing time?**

        Average time to process an order is less than 1 minutes. We do face certain delays from the blockchain in executing the transaction during peak hours but we are constantly evolving our product with best practices to give you the quickest possible transaction time.

        **35. What are the different payment states possible and their definition?**

        **38. How do we integrate Solana to our product.**

        Our tech stack will remain same no matter what chain we add , we want our users to make minimal changes to adopt new chains in their product , so to use Solana chain 
        the only change you need make is 
        - For widget - enabled required Solana token from your dashboard and once its done refresh your widget page it should show in dropdown list.
        - For api you need to use ChainId 102 for staging and 101 for production , with respective Token Symbol and its Smart contract address and create the orders. 

        sample api request for SOL token on staging environment is below

        **Note: Solana is non EVM chain hence its Wallet address will be different so kindly double check the wallet adderss so that it won't credit to wrong addres**

        2023 amendment brought by the Government of India to the Prevention of Money
        Laundering Act (PMLA) 2002 which brings all crypto businesses under the purview of
        PMLA. As a result, it is required of all crypto businesses in India to register with the
        Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Ministry of Finance of the Government of India
        and proactively report any suspicious activity. Onmeta has registered for the same
        and is complying with all the requirements.
